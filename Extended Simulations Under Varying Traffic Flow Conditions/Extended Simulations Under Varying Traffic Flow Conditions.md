# Extended Simulations Under Varying Traffic Flow Conditions
To verify the efficiency of the proposed HPQ algorithm systematically and comprehensively, we conducted 15-minute simulations to generate mixed random traffic flow. We select scenarios with traffic flows of approximately 1000 passenger car units/hour (pcu/h), 1300 pcu/h, and 1600 pcu/h to simulate the HPQ algorithm. The specific simulation videos are presented as follows: the first video illustrates the coordination results at an unsignalized intersection for a traffic flow rate of 1000 pcu/h, the second video demonstrates the coordination results for a traffic flow rate of 1300 pcu/h, and the third video showcases the results for a traffic flow rate of 1600 pcu/h. To facilitate efficient viewing and analysis, all videos are presented at three times their normal playback speed.
