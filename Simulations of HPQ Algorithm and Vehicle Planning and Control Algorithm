To comprehensively verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed unsignalized intersection management strategy, we conducted a large-scale simulation at a real-world intersection located in the Shanghai Intelligent and Connected Vehicle Test Zone. This intersection is a uniquely shaped three-way junction. Vehicles entered the intersection randomly with an initial speed of 9 m/s. The right-of-way for each vehicle was determined by the high-level HPQ algorithm. The results of these high-level calculations were then transmitted to the low-level vehicle terminals for subsequent vehicle planning and control. A total of 30 vehicles were involved in the simulation, providing a robust test of the system's performance under realistic conditions.
