To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed unsignalized intersection management strategy in mixed autonomy traffic streams, we conducted micro-simulations across a broader range of intersection configurations and traffic scenarios. Specifically, we created a digital twin simulation scenario based on a real-world four-way, three-lane intersection using the PreScan micro-simulation software. This approach illustrates the method's applicability to diverse applications and varying problem scales. The scenario layout is depicted in the accompanying video, representing a busy intersection located at the junction of Jianchuan Road and Dushi Road near Shanghai Jiao Tong University. In this four-way, three-lane intersection, we conducted comprehensive simulation experiments with mixed traffic flows, including connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), connected human-driven vehicles (CHVs), and un-connected human-driven vehicles (HVs). In the experiment, the black vehicles are CAVs, the white vehicles are CHVs, and the green vehicles and trucks are HVs.
